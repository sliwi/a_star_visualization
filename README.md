# Reflection
The goal of this personal project was to get familiar with web technologies in addition to implementing the A* algorithm.
Since the completion of this project, I have acquired new knowledge that would change my approach towards the implementation of this project.
In particular, this includes a good architecture, and better software design by increasing cohesion and reducing coupling. 
This project will eventualy be re-made and will include more graph-search algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search.
